1
00:00:00,285 --> 00:00:03,289
OMG

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,174
It's working

3
00:00:07,638 --> 00:00:11,220
Waaaaat?

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,846
They've reached Lichtenberg,
Mahlsdorf and Karlshorst to the east.

5
00:00:17,273 --> 00:00:21,060
Steiner's assault will
bring it under control.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,866
Mein Fï¿½hrer...

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,859
Steiner...

8
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:33,404
Steiner couldn't mobilize
enough men.

9
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:36,507
He wasn't able
to carry out his assault. (Uh Oh...)

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,512
These men will stay here:
Keitel, Jodl, Krebs and Burgdorf.

11
00:01:12,696 --> 00:01:14,535
That was an order!

12
00:01:14,988 --> 00:01:19,290
Steiner's assault was an order!
Who do you think you are

13
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:23,669
to dare disobey an order that I give?

14
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:28,259
So this is what it has come to!

15
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:30,922
The military has been lying to me.
//
16
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:33,900
Everybody has been lying to me.
Even the SS!

17
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:39,600
Our generals are just a bunch
of contemptible, disloyal cowards.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,150
I can't permit you
to insult the soldiers...

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,550
They are cowards,
traitors and failures!

20
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,875
Mein Fï¿½hrer, this is outrageous!

21
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,500
Our generals are the scum
of the German people!

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,600
Not a shred of honour!

23
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,800
They call themselves generals!
Years at military academy

24
00:02:00,225 --> 00:02:03,350
just to learn how to hold
a knife and fork!

25
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,475
For years, the military

26
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,900
has hindered my plans!

27
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,225
They've put every kind of obstacle

28
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,075
in my way!

29
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,575
What I should have done

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,150
is liquidate all the high-ranking
officers, as Stalin did!

31
00:02:26,575 --> 00:02:29,200
I never attended an academy,

32
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:36,600
and yet I have conquered Europe
all by myself!

33
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:41,975
Traitors!

34
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,250
I've been betrayed and deceived
from the very beginning!

35
00:02:48,118 --> 00:02:50,850
What a monstrous betrayal

36
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:55,700
of the German people.
But all those traitors will pay.

37
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:59,125
They'll pay with their own blood.

38
00:02:59,525 --> 00:03:02,425
They shall drown in their own blood!

39
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,200
Gerda, please calm yourself.

40
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,775
My orders have fallen on deaf ears.

41
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:23,300
Under these circumstances,
I am no longer able to lead...

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,975
It's over.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,575
The war is lost.

44
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:43,450
But, gentlemen, if you believe
I am going to leave Berlin,

45
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:48,625
you are seriously mistaken.
I'd rather blow my brains out.

46
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,500
Do whatever you like.
